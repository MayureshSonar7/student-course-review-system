📘 Student Course Review System:-
The Student Course Review System is a web-based application developed using Python Flask that allows students to view courses and submit reviews. The system provides a simple and user-friendly interface where users can register, log in, explore available courses, and share their feedback. This project is designed mainly for academic learning purposes and demonstrates the implementation of backend logic, database handling, and frontend integration using Flask.

This application follows a clean project structure with proper separation of concerns. Flask handles routing and backend logic, HTML templates are used for rendering dynamic pages, and CSS is used to enhance the user interface. The project also includes additional scripts for database testing and basic analysis, along with proper documentation.


🛠️ Technologies Used:-
The project is built using Python as the core programming language and Flask as the web framework. For frontend development, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap are used. The database is managed using SQLite, making the project lightweight and easy to set up. Dependency management is handled using a requirements.txt file.


📂 Project Structure Overview:-
The main application logic is contained in the app.py file, which manages routes, database configuration, and core functionality. The templates folder contains all HTML files required for rendering pages such as login, registration, course listing, adding courses, and submitting reviews. The static folder includes CSS styling and the favicon used by the application.

The scripts folder contains supporting Python scripts such as database testing and basic course analysis. The docs folder includes the project report in PDF format for documentation and academic submission purposes. A .gitignore file is included to prevent unnecessary files from being pushed to GitHub, and requirements.txt lists all required Python dependencies.


▶️ How to Run the Project Locally:-
To run this project on your local machine, first ensure that Python is installed. Clone the repository or download the project files, then navigate to the project directory. Create and activate a virtual environment, install the required dependencies using the requirements.txt file, and finally run the Flask application using python app.py. Once the server starts, the application can be accessed through the browser at http://127.0.0.1:5000.


🎯 Features:-
The system supports user registration and login functionality. Authenticated users can view available courses and submit reviews. The interface is responsive and styled using modern CSS and Bootstrap. The project structure follows best practices suitable for beginners and academic evaluation.


📄 Documentation:-
A detailed project report is available in the docs folder, explaining the system design, implementation details, and screenshots. This makes the project suitable for college submissions and demonstrations.
